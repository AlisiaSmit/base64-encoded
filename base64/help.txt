to encode an arbitrary file "infilename" in Base64-encoded text file "outfilename":
	base64.exe -e infilename outfilename
to decode Base64-encoded text file "infilename" in binary file "outfilename" 
(if the file contains non-base64 characters, an error is displayed):
	base64.exe -d infilename outfilename
to decode Base64-encoded text file "infilename" in binary file "outfilename"  
If the-i option is present, the non-Base64 characters are ignored during decoding:
	base64.exe -d -i infilename outfilename
to encode an arbitrary file "infilename" in Base64-encoded text file "outfilename"
If the-f N option is passed, insert a line feed every N characters in the output file:
